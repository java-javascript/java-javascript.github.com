<h4>REST Inspired Pragmatic Web-API Design</h4>

<p>REST as defined by 
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">Roy Fielding</a> 
exerts a wide influence yet is seldom adopted <i>in toto</i>.  
In <a href="http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api">Best Practices for a Pragmatic RESTful API</a>
Vinay Sahni summarizes factors that make an API flexible, easy to use, and easy to adopt.  His post differs from Fielding's relatively
abstract, theoretical definition of constraints and includes factors like security, documentation, versioning, and JSON style.
While he includes some discussion about linking (pagination) he explicitly cites HATEOAS as not quite ready for prime time, 
a concern that has relatively broad consensus among API  developers currently.  
</p>

<p>HATEOAS is still a topic of active interest of course.  <a href="http://jsonapi.org/">JSON API</a> is a JSON-based 
	read/write hypermedia-type designed to support a smart client who wishes build a data-store of information.
	Like the &quot;Best Practices&quot; post above, it is obviously REST inspired, but is tempered by concerns introduced
	by specific web application API design (the API is extracted from the JSON transport 
	defined by <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember's</a> REST adapter.)  
</p>

Securing Web APIs is another practical topic not addressed by REST directory.  James Ward
presents a well articulated explanation of how to	
<a href="http://www.jamesward.com/2013/05/13/securing-single-page-apps-and-rest-services">secure single page apps and REST services.</a> 
In many cases, security is the determining factor on the viability of an API.  Security is a practical constraint that influences
the adoption of an API to a much greater extent than other specified constraints that comprise REST.
</p>
<p>
The definition of REST in its theoretical purity is immensely valuable.   But the long term vision driving REST constraints 
introduces characteristics that are not flexible, easy to use, or easy to adopt.  The history of the web shows that real-world 
practicality wins over theoretical purity in the web world.  REST ought to continue be recognized in its function as a standard-bearer
but most projects will benefit with clear articulation of how to apply its principles effectively given current development 
expectations.
