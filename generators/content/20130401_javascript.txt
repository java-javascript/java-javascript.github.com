<h5>Angular and IE7</h5>

AngularJS is a great framework but there is some ambiguity on their site related to support for old versions of IE.    For instance <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/ie">the docs</a> reference IE7 specifically and there is even even discussion in the comments related to IE6.  However, it seems that functionality is limited in versions lower than IE8.  Angular is being <a href="From http://docs.angularjs.org/misc/faq">tested with IE8 and above</a>:

<blockquote>
What browsers does Angular work with?
<br/><br/>
We run our extensive test suite against the following browsers: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE8, IE9 and mobile browsers (Android, Chrome Mobile, iOS Safari).

An explanation for the decision to cease support for IE7 can be found in this <a href="https://vimeo.com/45624403">presentation</a> (starting at 36:18 in the video):

<blockquote>
Q.  Which browsers do you support?
<br/><br/>
A.  "…IE starting from version 8.  You could do 7 but we just gave up on 7….not because its impossible… it is just so painful to debug… we just said this is a waste of time, lets just focus on IE8."

Seeing that IE7 has less than 2% of the browser market it probably is a waste of time for the Angular team to dedicate resources to this work.  

<div id="browser_version_partially_combined-ww-monthly-201203-201303-bar" width="100%" height="300" style="width:100%; height: 300px;"></div><!-- You may change the values of width and height above to resize the chart --><p>Source: <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version_partially_combined-ww-monthly-201203-201303-bar">StatCounter Global Stats - Browser Version (Partially Combined) Market Share</a></p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.statcounter.com/js/FusionCharts.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://gs.statcounter.com/chart.php?browser_version_partially_combined-ww-monthly-201203-201303-bar"></script>

But if you are in the unfortunate situation of having to support IE7, you may want to consider options other than Angular.
