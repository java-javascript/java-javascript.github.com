<h4>JDK 7 for OSX: java.net.UnknownHostException</h4>
<p>
	TLDR: Add the name of your machine to /etc/hosts.  
</p>
<p>
	When working on a <a href='http://www.playframework.com/'>play</a> app in JDK 7 on OSX using 
	JDK 7: a java.net.UnknownHostException occurred  (nodename nor servname provided, or not known).
	The specific versions involved.
	<table>
		<tr><th>Component</th>			<th>Version</th></tr>
		<tr><td>OSX</td>				<td>10.7.5</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Play</td>				<td>2.1.1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Java Full Version</td>	<td>1.7.0_21-b12</td></tr>
	</table>
